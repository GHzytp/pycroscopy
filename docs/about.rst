Pycroscopy Package
==================

**Scientific analysis of nanoscience data**

.. attention::

   The pycroscopy ecosystem of packages have been undergoing a major restructuring process.
   The pycroscopy python package is being completely restructured under the `phoenix <https://github.com/pycroscopy/pycroscopy/tree/phoenix>`_ branch.
   Those wishing to continue to use the legacy version of pycroscopy can do so using the `legacy <https://github.com/pycroscopy/pycroscopy/tree/legacy>`_ branch.

.. note::
   **Weekly Hackathons**

   We run weekly hackathons to develop the pycroscopy ecosystem of python packages.
   Hackathons are held every Friday 3-5PM USA Eastern time.
   The requirements for participation are: knowledge of python, git,
   and the basic structure and philosophy of the pycroscopy ecosystem (available through documentation).
   If you would like to participate, please email us at vasudevanrk *at* ornl.gov
